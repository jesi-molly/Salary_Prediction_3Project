# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts employee salary based on years of experience using a Linear Regression model.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:
- YearsExperience
- Salary

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 🧪 Steps Followed
1. Loaded the dataset from CSV
2. Prepared data (selected input and output columns)
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Predicted salary on test data
6. Evaluated model using RMSE and R²
7. Saved the trained model

## 📈 Model Performance
- RMSE: Low value indicates good prediction accuracy
- R² Score: Close to 1 shows strong prediction

## 💾 Model Saving
The trained model is saved as `salary_prediction_model.pkl`

## ✅ Conclusion
The model successfully predicts salary based on experience and performs well on evaluation metrics.
